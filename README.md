If anything is missing, misplaced, or you want a new category, then please write a comment or [open an issue](https://github.com/Zottelchens-WoW-Addons/AdiBags-Legion/issues). There are literally thousands of item IDs in this addon, so it's possible that I missed or misplaced something. Report these items & I will fix them ASAP. Thanks! :)
