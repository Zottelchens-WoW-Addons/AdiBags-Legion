# AdiBags - Legion

**Adds multiple (optionally colored) categories for the most common Legion items in AdiBags (AdiBags is required!):**

- Artifact Power (disabled by default, because they are now grey items and have no purpose but selling them)
- Ancient Mana
- Artifact Relics
- Champion Equipment
- Champion Upgrades
- Bait (disabled by default)
- Rare Fish (disabled by default)
- Legion Reputation items
- Broken Shore items

**NEW IN VERSION 2.0 - THE HUGE UPDATE:**

- Localization (feel free to contribute on Curseforge!)
- Mergeable Categories
- Custom Colors
- A Prefix you can customize
- A better UI (Categories, Dividers and alphabetical order)

If anything is missing, misplaced, or you want a new category, then please write a comment or [open an issue](https://github.com/Zottelchen/adibags-legion/issues).
